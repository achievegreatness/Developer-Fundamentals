#Git

What is git and why is it used?

In software development, many people will be working on a single project. Many people may want to edit a single file at once. So, we need to control edits to a file from multiple developers. We also want to keep track of our code changes over time to be able to revert to earlier versions of the project if necessary. 

The term for a mechanism such as this is a version control system or VCS. Several VCSs exist such as SVN, CVS, Clearcase, Mercurial... the list goes on. This article will focus on Git.
